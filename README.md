#### STATUS OF APPLICATION ####

1. the folder "client" is the react application
2. all of the other folders are part of the passport/login application that is done with mysql
3. the database name "passport_demo" might need to be created in order for the login application to work
4. run "node server.js" in Project3 folder to start the login app
5. run "yarn start" inside the client folder in order to start the react app

#### GOALS ####

1. integrate the login and react apps which would look like this:
2. the first page is the initial register/login page
3. then once logged in, we are routed to the react app (the react app is just once page for now)
4. ultimately I want the "log out" functionality that is currently part of the passport/login application to be placed inside the react application
